<h1 align="center">Freeway</h1>
<p>I made a game based on the classic Freeway, originally released in 1981 for the Atari 2600 console, that has as its objective to help a chicken cross a busy highway, avoiding being hit by cars at high speed. The chicken starts at the edge of the road and must reach the other side without being hit by any vehicle. The player controls the chicken using the arrow keys, moving it forward, backward, right side, and left side, and must synchronize his movements to avoid collisions with the moving cars.</p>

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>In this project I made a points system where on the left side are the points you get by crossing the avenue and the right side for maximum points record. I used a cow as the main character instead of the chicken.</p>

<h3>Detail</h3>
<p>I made this project based on the programming logic classes (Programming Logic: Loops and Lists with JavaScript) at Alura and you can see my profile of the courses I've done <a href="https://cursos.alura.com.br/user/gabrieldossantossilva69">here.</a></p>
