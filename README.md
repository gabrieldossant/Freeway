<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>I made a game based on the classic Freeway that has as its objective to help a chicken cross a busy highway, avoiding being hit by cars at high speed. The chicken starts at the edge of the road and must reach the other side without being hit by any vehicle. The player controls the chicken using the arrow keys, moving it forward, backward, right side, and left side, and must synchronize his movements to avoid collisions with the moving cars. The game is considered a video game classic, originally released in 1981 for the Atari 2600 console.</p>
